# Biomedical-Devices
Contains all my code used during Biomedical Healthcare Design in University. This repository is to show my skillsets when it comes to python programming applied in a medical use case.

Bitalino is a breakout board with several pheripheral sensors designed to track certain outputs of a human body: 

1. an EMG (electromyography) to track muscle activation

2. an EDA (electrodermal Activity) to measure skin activity/moisture levels

3. a LUX light sensor to monitor ambient light or (used in conjunction with a light source) to track blood volume pulse data

4. an ECG (electrocardiogram) to track heart rate, monitor stress etc

5. an accelerometer to track limb movements
